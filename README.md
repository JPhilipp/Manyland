# Manyland

This is a set of classes of the 2d social sandbox universe <a href="http://manyland.com">Manyland</a>. The code relates to the Painter, Interactings, Dynamics, and Multis. It's part of a much bigger project, and sorry, some classes are in need of a split-up refactoring. Hope it's of use!
